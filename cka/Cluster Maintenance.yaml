Cluster Maintenace

OS Upgrade
  Ex. Path/Upgrade of Nodes
  Nodes down = Pods down
  If node is not available for 5minutes, the pods on the Nodes are evicted and created on another node (if replcaset)
  thats Pod eviction timeout
    kube-controller-manager --pod-eviction-timeout=5m0s

  If you want to safely remove/move the Pods out of the Node, and set the Node unschedulable
    kubectl drain node-1  (gracefully remove and move pods to other nodes)
    kubectl cordon node-2  (set node as unschedulable)
    kubectl uncordon node-1  (set node as scheduleable)  


Kubernetes verions
  v1.11.3  (major, minor, path)
  etcd and coreDNS has their own versions because they are separate projects


 Cluster Upgrade Process
  The components can have different versions
  kube-apiserver should be the highest version (if they will be different), no other component can be higher
  Example:
    if kube-apiserver is at version X
    controller-manager and kube-scheduler can be X-1
    kubelet and kube-proxy can be X-2

    kubectl can be +-1X of kube-apiserver version


    kuberbetes support 3 minor versions
    ex. if latest GA is 1.12  - kubernetes supports: 1.12, 1.11 and 1.10

    Upgrade should be 1 minor version at a time

  How to upgrade?
    if using AKS,EKS or GCP managed kuberbetes, they have their button to upgrade
    if using hardway - you have to upgrade yourself
    if kubeadm

    1. Upgrade Master nodes first - kubernetes admins/management are unavailable but atleast applications are not
    2. Upgrade worker nodes next (with master node 1 higher version is supported)
        - upgrade all worker nodes at once - but this means applications will not be available
        - upgrade worker nodes at a time
        - add new nodes to cluster with new version
      kubeadm upgrade plan
      Note: kubeadm does not upgrade the kubelet's
      Note: you have to upgrade kubeadm first before upgrading the cluster

      steps: example current version 1.11
      1. upgrade kubeadm to 1.12
          apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00
      2. proceed with cluster upgrade
          kubeadm upgrade apply v1.12.0
          Note: kubelet on master is not upgraded
      3. upgrade kubelet on master if it has kubelet
          apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00
          systemctl restart kubelet
      4. upgrade the kubetlet on worker nodes
          upgrade 1 at a time
          kubectl drain node01
          apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00
          apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00
          kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version v1.12.0
          systemctl restart kubelet
          kubectl uncordon node01
      5. upgrade the remaining the other nodes with same steps
