Scheduling
    Scheduling pods

    in the pod definition there is a hidden element under spec
    scheduler identifies which node the pod will be created and sets the binding
    if there is no node binded to the pod, the pod stays on pending status

Manual Scheduling
    manually specify the nodename in the pod definition - only at creation time
    cannot be altered anymore
    specifying the node manually to existing pod is to
    create a binding object (yaml file) and send a POST request to the pods binding API (URL)
    data must be in json format


Labels and Selectors
    properties attach to an object
    grouping things together (ex. animals - color, class, type, etc)
    kubernetes uses labels and selectors internally 
    it is used by service to identify the pods
    it is used by replicaset to identify the pods in the matchLabels

    add as many labels as you like
    to get objects using selector as filter
    kubectl get pods --selector app=App1

    annotations is same level as labels but this is for just information purpose, like contact info, build version
    
    kubectl get pods -l env=dev,bu=finance | wc -l
    kubectl get all -l env=prod --no-headers


Taints and Tolerations
    Node are people with bug repellant lotion and pods are bugs
    Taints on node and toleration on pods
    Taints and Tolerations are meant to be used for allowing pods on nodes that pass a certain toleratons

    TAINTING
    kubectl taint nodes <nodename> key=value:taint-effect
    kubectl taint nodes Node01 color=blue:NoSchedule/PreferNoSchedule/NoExecute   (this is the effect on pods that does not tolerate)

    NoSchedule - PODS will not be scheduled
    PreferNoSchedule - scheduler tries not to schedule a pod but not guaranteed
    NoExecute - new pods will not be scheduled on the node, and existing pods will be removed if they do not tolerate

    Tolerations
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: 
        image: 
      tolerations:
      - key: "color"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "blue"
        effect: "NoSchedule"

    kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep Taint
